# How to run
There are two ways to run this application:
1) You can download src code and compile it by yourself or an IDE
2) You can also download directly from my release [snapshot-1.1](https://github.com/wolverinepp1/BNPSuperMarket/releases/download/snapshot1.1/BNPSuperMarket.jar) and run it in a console such as powershell in window or terminal in Linux by just typing
   "java -jar BNPSuperMarket.jar"
